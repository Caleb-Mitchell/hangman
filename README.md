# Hangman

> Made in 2020, this was my final project for [Code In Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/), an excellent introduction to coding offered by Stanford University
> at the start of the pandemic.

> This was originally made with the help of boilerplate code provided in the form of method names, along with comments suggesting implementation ideas.

A simple hangman word guessing game written in Python, with simple graphics implemented using tkinter.

Stanford CS106A was offered during the COVID-19 crisis. The course accepted 8,000 students out of 80,000 applicants, and its focus was on an introduction to Python.

The following is a video demo I made to showcase my project upon completion:
